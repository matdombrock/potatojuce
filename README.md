(This is not what it looks like.)

## Setup:
```
./pi-deps.sh
```
[Source](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/docs/Linux%20Dependencies.md)

## Build

Building *should* be as easy as:
```
./build.sh
```

## Run
Running *should* be as easy as:
```
./run.sh
```

## Juce Lib Included?
This is because its not easy to get Projucer running on ARM and its easier to do it this way than to to depend on Projucer to setup the project correctly. 

# Le Potato

The “Le Potato” single board computer available from Libre Computers is an alternative to the Raspberry Pi. It is modeled after the Raspberry Pi 3 and is largely compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 and it’s accessories (with some limitations/caveats). It can even run Raspberry Pi OS / Raspbian.

It costs about 1/3rd of what a Raspberry Pi does while coming with 2GB of memory. It’s also widely available as well (unlike the pi).

- Green - GPIO (General)
- Red - 5v
- Orange - 3.3v
- Blue - ADC
- Dark - Ground

> Official Docs: [...] GPIOs on the Le Potato are highlighted in green. 5V pins are red, 3.3V pins are orange, ADC pins are blue. Other un-highlighted pins are ground with the exception of the pins on the top right header.
